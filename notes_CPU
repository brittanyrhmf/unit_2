Register - small chunks of memory - stores a single value 
RAM - larger bank of memory

CPU - Heart of the computer, used to execute programs
- It works with ‘instructions’

MICROARCHITECTURE:
- 4byts: opcode
- 4byts: specify where data for operation should come from
- Instruction address register 
- Instruction register

ALL REGISTERS START AT 0

1. Fetch phase
  2. Decode phase
3. Interpreted by control unit
4. Execute phase

The clock: triggers an electrical signal at precise and regular interval. The signal is used by the CU to advance internal operation of the CPU keeping everything lock-step.
Clock Speed is the speed at which the cpu can carry out each step of the fetch-decode execute (Hertz - Hz)
